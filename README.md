# RoQME: RoQME: Dealing with non-functional properties through global Robot Quality-of- Service MEtrics

Building systems out of components requires taking into account both functional and non-functional properties. Non-functional properties define “how” a system performs rather than “what” it does. Examples of non-functional properties include dependability, safety, security, resource consumption, customer satisfaction, etc.

[RobMoSys](https://robmosys.eu) takes non-functional properties into account from the very beginning, treating them as first-class citizens. RobMoSys considers the management of non-functional properties as key added-value services built on top of its Ecosystem. In this vein, the [RoQME](https://robmosys.eu/roqme/) Itegrated Technical Project (ITP) wants to contribute to RobMoSys a model-based framework for dealing with system-level non-functional properties, enabling the specification of global robot Quality of Service (QoS) metrics defined in terms of the (internal and external) contextual information available.

The RoQME Tool Chain, delivered here as a free and open source Eclipse plug-in, provides both modelling and code generation tools, enabling the creation of actual RobMoSys-compliant components, readily usable in RobMoSys-based solutions as QoS information providers. This information could then be used by other components for different purposes, e.g., robot behaviour adaptation or benchmarking.
